title: "About"

I'm Alex Wein. I work as a data engineer in San Francisco.  Here are a few things I'm nerdy about:

- R's Tidyverse
- Data Visualization
- Pop Music
- Linguistics
- Tax Policy
- Functional Programming
- The Metaphysics of Fictional Worlds

Some of those overlap, like in my talk "Charts as Utterances", that I gave at the data visualization conference Tapestry. You can watch [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpAfmTgcGPY), read [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yOmkpES3IZB__sJqLT1yILWuN3ErixUDhg0NZ9O48OY) or browse [the github repo](https://github.com/a-lexwein/tapestry-utterances).
