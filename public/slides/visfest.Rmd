# Math

1. Assumptions
1. Definitions
1. Inferences (Theorems)


## $=$ &nbsp;&nbsp; vs.&nbsp;&nbsp; $=_{def}$


---

# Set theory is a foundation for the rest of math

1. Define natural numbers in terms of sets
1. Define integers in terms of natural numbers
1. Rational numbers are based on integers
1. Real numbers are constructed from rational numbers.

* (Then there's this thing called Category Theory)

---

# What does any of this have to do with data visualization?

1. We'll leverage intuitions about viz to understand this stuff.
1. Viz isn't just about the visuals, it's about the mapping from data to visuals.
1. Gives us a little bit of machinery to compare different types of data viz.
1. Datasets are sets.

---

# Where we're going: **functions**

1. A function is a special kind of relation
1. A relation is a subset of a cartesian product
1. A cartesian product is a special set of ordered pairs
1. An ordered pair is a special kind of set

#### A function is a special kind of set which is a special kind of set built from a special kind of set of special kinds of sets.

---

# Sets

It's a collection of things.  That's it.

Sets are defined solely in terms of membership. Given any two sets $A$ and $B$, either:

$A \in B$ or $A \notin B$.

$\in$ means "is in" or "is a member of"
$\notin$ means "is not in"

[]

---

# Assumptions for Set Theory

1. Extensionality
1. Empty Set
1. Pairing
1. Union
1. Powerset
1. Separation

* Some other ones we're gonna pay less attention to for now.

---

# Assumption 1 - Extensionality

## We need to define equality.

## Two sets are "the Same" if they have the same members ( $A = B$ )

$\{a, b, c\}  = \{b, a, c\}  = \{a,a,a, b , c\}$

Order doesn't matter, uniqueness is baked into the definition.

---

# Subset: $A \subseteq B$

We say "A is a subset of B" if every element of A is an element of B.

Every set is a subset of itself.

If $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq C$, then $A \subseteq C$

1. dogs are a subset of animals
1. dogs named Sparky are a subset of dogs.
1. dogs named Sparky are a subset of animals.
1. natural numbers are a subset of integers.
1. Youtube Employees are a subset of Google Employees.
1. Every scatterplot ever made is a subset of every data visualization ever made.

Given two sets, either the first is a subset of the second or its not!

If "A is not a subset of B" ( $A	\nsubseteq B$ ), that means there's some element $b \in B$ where $b \notin A$.

# Assumption 2 -  Empty Set $\varnothing$

Set membership and equality don't actually give us any sets.  We need to give ourselves a starting point.

Let's assume there exists a set containing no elements.  We can denote it as $\{\}$, but it's helpful to give the empty set its own symbol $\varnothing$.

**Vacuous Quantification** - when you have a definition based on "every member of a set", it's going to be true for the empty set. For instance, $\varnothing$ is a subset of every other set.

---

# Assumption 3 - Pairing $\{ A, B \}$

Given two sets A and B, we can construct a set with just those two elements.


**Singleton**: special case when $A = B$...pairing gives us  $\{A, A\} = \{A\}$

---

# Infinite Sets from Nothing

1. Assumption 2 gave us exactly one set to build with: $\varnothing$.
1. Let's apply pairing to construct a new (different) set $\{\varnothing\}$. These are not the same set!
1. Now we have two sets.
  1. We can now pair $\{\varnothing\}$ with itself to get $\{\{\varnothing\}\}$
  1. Or we can pair $\{\varnothing\}$ with $\varnothing$ to get $\{\varnothing,\{\varnothing\}\}$.
1. We can go on and on like that forever, it's a good way to define the natural numbers $\{0, 1, 2, ...\}$.

---

# Assumption 4 - Union: $\bigcup A$

Given a set $A$, there's a set containing every element of every element of $A$.

So supposed we have three sets

$$ X = \\{a,b,c\\} $$
$$ Y = \\{c,d,e\\}$$
$$ Z = \\{f\\}$$

Then $\bigcup \{X,Y,Z\}$ is equal to

$$ \\{ a,b,c,d,e,f \\} $$
--

## The binary form is helpful syntax:

# $A \cup B =_{def} \bigcup \{A,B\}$ 

---

# Assumption 5 -  Powerset: $P(A)$

For any set A, there's a sets whose members are the subsets of A.

So, no matter what A is, we know $\varnothing \in P(A)$ and $A \in P(A)$

# Assumption 6 - Separation

If $A$ is a set and $P[x]$ is a condition on $x$ (where $x$ is a variable that ranges over sets), then there is a set, written

# $\{ x \in A \,|\, P[x]\}$

whose members are all the x in A that satisfy P[x].

The $|$ symbol can be read as "such that".


---

# Intersection $A \cap B$

Let's define the intersection of two sets A and B,

# $A \cap B =_{def} \{a \in A |\, a \in B\}$.

We don't need to assume intersection, because it is a special case of separation.

People who use R and Python.

1. $A \cap B = B \cap A$
1. If $A \subseteq B$, then $A \cap B = A$
1. $A \cap \varnothing = \varnothing$
1. we say that A and B are **disjoint** if $A \cap B = \varnothing$


---

## Ordered Pairs $\langle A, B \rangle$

1. Sets don't have order to them $\{ A, B \} = \{ B, A \}$.
1. But we want ourselves a way to talk about order.
1. If $A \neq B$, then we want $\langle A, B \rangle \neq \langle B, A \rangle$

---

## Definition of an ordered pair

# $\langle A, B \rangle = \{\{A\}, \{A,B\}\}$


This is built out 3 applications of the pairing assumption.

---

# Cartesian Product, $A \times B$

The set of all ordered pairs $\langle a, b\rangle$ such that $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.

---
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
A <- c("p", "q", "r")
B <- c("x", "y", "z")
AxB <- tidyr::crossing(A,B)

AxB %>%
  mutate(pair = paste0("{", A, ", ", B, "}")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = A, y = B, label = pair)) +
  geom_text(size = 10) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("A x B") +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 20),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 20),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 25))
```


---

# More dimensions.

1. We have ordered pairs. How about triplets.
1. # $\langle a,b,c \rangle =_{def} \langle \langle a, b \rangle, b \rangle$
1. ##  $A \times B \times C =_{def} (A \times B) \times C$
1. bigger ordered tuples, and cartesian products are also constructed recursively.

---

# Relations!

## Simple definition

## Really powerful concept

--

## A Relation $R$ between $A$ and $B$ is a subset of $A \times B$.

### we can use the notation $a\,R\,b$ to mean $\langle a,b \rangle \in R$


Important special case $B = A$, then we have a relation **on** A.

## Representing Relations: Using set notation

# HadForDinner =

$$
\\{
\langle Amir, Pasta \rangle,
\langle Beatrice, PorkChop \rangle,
\langle Carlos, PorkChop \rangle,
\langle\ Carlos, Salad \rangle
\\}
$$

---

## Representing Relations: As a table.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
HadForDinner <- tibble(
 person = c("Amir", "Beatrice", "Carlos", "Carlos"),
 food = c("Pasta", "PorkChop", "PorkChop", "Salad")
)
knitr::kable(HadForDinner,format='html')
```

---

## Representing Relations: As a grid

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(HadForDinner, aes(x = person, y = food)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  ggtitle("{person} had {food} for dinner") +
    theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 20),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 20),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 25))
```

---
## Order isn't doesn't matter for sets.

### These are equivlanet:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 9}
library(patchwork)
dinner_grid <- ggplot(HadForDinner, aes(x = person, y = food)) + geom_point(size = 4) + ggtitle("{person} had {food} for dinner")

reordered_dinner <- HadForDinner %>%
  mutate(person = factor(person, levels = c("Beatrice", "Carlos", "Amir")),
         food = factor(food, levels = c("PorkChop", "Pasta", "Salad"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = person, y = food)) + geom_point(size = 4) + ggtitle("{person} had {food} for dinner")

dinner_grid + reordered_dinner
```

# Inverse Relation: $R^{-1}$

 $R^{-1} =_{def} \{ \langle x,y \rangle \,|\, y R x\}$

A relation $R$ is a subet of $A \times B$, its inverse $R^{-1}$ is a subset of $B \times A$, by flipping the arrows.

# Examples of inverse relations:

1. is greater than; is less than
1. loves; is loved by
1. is the parent of; is the child of
1. is the sibling of; is the sibling of

# Composition

Given two relations, we can combine them: Since they're just sets, we can union them together or take their intersection, but we can also compose them:

Examples of relation compostion:

1. is the grandfather of = is the father of the father of.
1. is the brother-in-law of.
1. function composition, which we'll get to soon.

Given a relation R

 $(R^{-1})^{-1}  = R$
 
 $id_a \circ R = R$
 
 $R \circ id_b = R$

# Special Properties of Relations on A

1. Reflexive
1. Symmetric
1. Transitive

---

A relation $R$ on $A$ is **reflexive** if $x\,R\,x$ for all $x \in A$.

* Equivalent definition: $id_A \subseteq R$

A relation is **irreflexive** if $\langle x , x \rangle \notin R$ for all $x \in A$.

* Equivalent defintion: $id_A \cap R = \varnothing$

<br />
<br />


![](images/5-elements-reflexive.png)

--

What's do reflexive relations look like as grids?

---

A relation $R$ on $A$ is **symmetric** if $a\,R\,b$ implies $a \,R\, b$ for all $a,b \in A$.

* Equivalently, $R = R^{-1}$

A relation is **asymmetric** if $a\,R\,b$ implies $\langle a, b \rangle \notin R$ for all $a,b \in A$.

* Equivalently, $R \cap R^{-1} = \varnothing$

A relation is **antisymmetric** if $a\,R\,b$ and $a\,R\,b$ imply $a = b$ for all $a,b \in A$

* A relation is asymmetric if it is antisymmetric and irreflexive.

<br /><br />
![](images/5-elements-symmetric.png)
--

What does a symmetric relation look like as a grid?

---

A relation is **transitive** if $a\,R\,b$ and $b\,R\,c$ implies $a\,R\,c$ for all $a,b,c \in A$.

* Equivalently: $R \circ R \subseteq R$

A relation is **intransitive** if $a\,R\,b$ and $b\,R\,c$ implies $\langle a,c \rangle \notin R$ for all $a,b,c \in A$.

# **Equivalence Relation**

A relation is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

![](images/equivalence-relation.png)

An equivlance relationship on A partitions A into disjoint subsets.

We'll return to equivalence relations soon.

---

# Functions (we made it!)

A relation $F$ is called a function from A to B, provided for every $a\in A$ there exists a unique $b \in B$ such that $a\,F\,b$.

---

![](images/isfun_empty_2to1.png)

# Is it a function?

--
1. ## is friends with 
--

1. ## is the boss of
--

1. ## is the mother of
--

1. ## is married to
--

1. ## A = passengers on a airline flight, B = seats on the airplane

---
# Is this a function?

--

1. ## $ y = 4x^2 - 3x + 4$
--

1. ## $x^2 + y^2 = 1$
--

1. ## $y = log(x)$

---

# One to One: injective

---

# Onto: Surjective

---

# Bijective: one-to-one and onto

if f A to B is a bijective function, then f^{-1} is also a bijective function.

If f isn't bijective, it's inverse is not a function.

---
# Different Flavors of Set Theory

To get a fully foundational set theory, we need a few more assumptions.

Not stuff I understand well.

---

# Table Space

Tidy Data (from Hadley Wickham):

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

What you can do with a table:

add a column (map)
remove a column
remove some rows (filter)
aggregate (reduce)

What you can do with two tables:

1. Glue them together rowwise (binding or unioning)
1. glue them together columnwise (joining)


---

# Category Theory

1. I only sort of understand what it is.
1. But as I understand it, the coolest thing in the world!
