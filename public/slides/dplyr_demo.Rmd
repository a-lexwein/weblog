## What we'll cover:
- What's R?
- What's a data frame?
- What's the pipe (`%>%`)?
- manipulating data frames with dplyr and pipes.

## What is R?
- __R__ is an open source programming language built initially for statistical analysis that has evolved into a full-service language for data science.
- Often run interactively.
- It's a programming language with all that programming language stuff: primitive types, functions, loops, functional and object-oriented styles.
- __Base R:__ functionality of R when you install it, without using any libraries.
- __RStudio__ is an integrated development environment for using R.

## Should you, a Javascript web developer, care about R?
- No
- but...maybe?

## The tidyverse
- a set of libraries (packages) that handle the central aspects of data science.
- One tidyverse package: __dplyr__, the main data manipulation package.
- Sometimes called the Hadley-verse. The lead developer on the packages is named Hadley Wickham.
- The packages play really well together: manipulating data with __dplyr__ then charting it with __ggplot2__.
- Good documentation (www.tidyverse.org), really well designed software.
- Easy to learn (as far as coding goes), but deeply expressive.
- Best resource: R For Data Science (Wickham & Grolemund) (http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
- RStudio cheat sheets are great, too.

## data frames
- It's a rectangle with numbers (or strings) in it!
- rows represent observations
- columns represent properties (variables). Variables have names.
- all values in a column have the same type.


----
```{r, message=FALSE}
## install.packages('dplyr') # first time you run, need to install
library(dplyr) # call to use dplyr
starwars # a sample dataset preinstalled with dplyr
```


## What do you do with a rectangle of data:

- **add new variables based on existing data: ** BMI = mass/(height^2)
- **remove existing variables (or rearrange columns)** hair color won't be used in our analysis.
- **remove rows:** exclude droids, exclude any characters that are missing data for height or mass (like Grand Moff Tarkin)
- **sort the rows:** which character has the highest BMI? (It's Jabba!)
- **aggregate all rows into one:** what's the average BMI of non-droid Star Wars characters?

## What that looks like in dplyr:
```{r}
starwars %>%
  mutate(bmi = mass/((height/100)^2)) %>%
  select(name, species, bmi) %>%
  filter(species != 'Droid') %>%
  filter(!is.na(bmi)) %>%
  arrange(desc(bmi)) %>%
  summarise(avg_bmi = mean(bmi), observations = n())
```


## Other things you do with data frames:
- aggregate into groups instead of just one line
- combine two data frames together:
    + combining observations: two data frames with the same variables.
    + augmenting observations: joining data frames based on common attributes.
- dplyr handles these, too: `group_by(), bind_rows(), left_join()` and other joins.

## These manipulations are the spine of data analysis, and every data analysis framework has a way to do all of this.
- If you've used spreadsheets a little, you've probably done a lot of this: sort, vlookup, pivot tables, filter.
- In a spreadsheet workflow, they don't feel like a unified set of operations, and they can be hard to combine.
- I've done this using a lot of tools...dplyr is __The Right Way__.

# Pipes %>%

## A Function in R
- functions in base R look a lot like javascript.
```{r}
add <- function(a,b) {
  sum <- a+b
  return(a+b)
}
```
```{r}
add(1,2)
add(add(1,2),3)
```

## The pipe %>%
- The pipe changes the syntax of R with the following rule:
```{r eval=FALSE}
 val1 %>% fun(val2) ==> fun(val1,val2)
```
- The value to the left of the pipe becomes the first argument of the function its right
- `==>` is not code
- `|` in terminal is also a pipe function.

## So we got
```{r}
add(1, 2)
1 %>% add(2)
add(add(1, 2), 3)
1 %>% add(2) %>% add(3)
```

```{r}
add(add(1,2),3)
1 %>% add(2) %>% add(3)
```

----

- Good style: end lines with a pipe `%>%`, indent piped-into lines.

```{r}
1 %>%
  add(2) %>%
  add(3)
```


## What's so great about this?
- Data flows left to right and top to bottom
- Code becomes a lot more readable
- Easy to compose, debug, turn expressions into functions

## dplyr
- A library of pure functions to handle the most common data manipulations.
- The functions make up a grammar of data frame manipulations.
- `select(), filter(), arrange(), mutate(), summarise()`
- `group_by(), bind_rows(), left_join()`
- these are functions that take a data frame as their first argument and return a data frame (which is great for piping!)
- I've used it for years and it's still very conjure-y to me (the heavy lifting is C++)

## pure functions:
- Don't change the input
- Don't have side effects (since R is used interactively)
- Always map input to the same output
- Have javascript Array.prototype HOFs in mind: `map(), filter(), sort()`, and `reduce()` where `acc` is an array.

## Why are pure functions great for data analysis?
- (Don't change input) You definitely don't want to make any changes to your original data.
- (Don't have side effects) Since R is used interactively a lot, you're more susceptible to side-effects.
- (Map input to deterministic output) If it's not deterministic, it's not even data analysis: reproducibility is the whole game!

## The pipe we wrote at the beginning

```{r}
starwars %>%
  mutate(bmi = mass/((height/100)^2)) %>%
  select(name, species, bmi) %>%
  filter(species != 'Droid') %>%
  filter(!is.na(bmi)) %>%
  arrange(desc(bmi)) %>%
  summarise(avg_bmi = mean(bmi), observations = n())
```

## Without Pipes
```{r}
step1 <- mutate(starwars, bmi = mass/((height/100)^2))
step2 <-select(step1, name, species, bmi)
step3 <-filter(step2, species != 'Droid')
step4 <- filter(step3, !is.na(bmi))
step5 <- arrange(step4, desc(bmi))
step6 <- summarise(step5, avg_bmi = mean(bmi), observations = n())
step6
```

```{r}
summarise(arrange(filter(filter(select(mutate(starwars,
  bmi = mass/((height/100)^2)), name, species, bmi),
  species != 'Droid'),!is.na(bmi)), desc(bmi)),
  avg_bmi = mean(bmi), observations = n())
```
